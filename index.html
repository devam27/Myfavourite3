        <p>Cricket is my favorite hobby and a famous sport too. It makes me feel healthy, fit and a stronger person. It makes me feel confident and proud of what I am. I started playing cricket when I was a kid of 7 years old.<br>
  <br>
        
My cricket passion started when I was a small kid and I started playing this game with my elder brother in the back side of my home. At that time also I was a good player in comparison to the children of my age. May be because I love to play cricket and I play it too seriously focusing on each and every ball.  My days were never complete without cricket I used to play with my friends after my school hours were over. Later with time I learnt to play cricket well and started participating in my school teams. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. </p>
